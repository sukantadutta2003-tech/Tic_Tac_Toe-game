# Tic_Tac_Toe-game
This project is a classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java, allowing two players to compete against each other on a 3Ã—3 grid. Players take turns marking their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell, and the game automatically checks for a win or draw after each move. The program features clear input prompts, a visually structured game board, and efficient logic to validate moves and determine results. It demonstrates the use of loops, conditional statements, arrays, and basic object-oriented programming concepts in Java. The game runs entirely in the console, making it lightweight and easy to execute.
